# Easy Wiring: A Project Born from Frustration

## Introduction

I have started this project because I was looking for an easy to use, yet actually useful software tool to design circuit/wiring diagrams with.
Yet every piece of software I've found, both free to use and hideously expensive, was utter garbage.
So, since I've deluded myself into thinking I can make a better piece of ~~shit~~ software, I've started this.

See the Design Document for a list of desired features ~~(as if they will ever be implemented...)~~

Oh, one last thing: I have ***no idea*** when I'll ever get around to actually write this thing.
