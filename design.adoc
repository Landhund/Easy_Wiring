== Overview

=== Platform

Big Question: Web based or local application?
Can I run a local web server type of thing?
If local, what environment? Java? Python?


=== UI

* Layout similar to Siemens LOGO! Soft Comfort

=== UX

==== Connections

* again similar to Soft Comfort
* each Connection must "know" which objects/elements it connects to/with/together
* optional label within the line
* optional contact/terminal ID/label
* only orthogonal directions
* drag-and-drop of existing connections to move them
* drag-and-drop from one connector to another
* Connections have a "Type", i.e. "AC 230 V", "DC 24 V", which is set by their connected Connectors
** If a Connection connects Connectors of different Types, an Error is created.
** Connections of undefined Type are valid.

==== Objects

* each Object has configurable Connectors
** Connectors can be set for each side independently
** Connectors can be visually grouped together
** Connectors can be internally connected or switched
** Types are optional for Connectors. If a Connector has no set Type, it takes on the Type of the connected Connection (if set).
* each Object is categorized and labeled according to link:designdoc_resources\tables\EN_IEC_81346-2_A1.adoc[EN IEC 81346-2:2019, Table 1]
